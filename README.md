# tdd-practice

This project is designed to practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) by implementing various utility functions and methods in JavaScript. The main goal is to write tests first and then implement the corresponding functions to pass those tests. The project includes common operations such as string manipulation, mathematical calculations, and array analysis.
